# Shell Documentation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Keep in mind that this small project is intrinsically a constant WIP since I use it as my own form of documentation. As I learn more, I will keep this repository updated with new commits.

## Description
The following project is a personnal documentation for Shell basics, and Shell programming. It is meant to be both as descriptive and as simple as possible to help in remembering the various elements touched on in this short simplified manual.

## Guidelines
As i mentionned, it is meant to be thorough documentation, but it prioritizes intelligibility. Therefor, some aspects may be given less attention in favor of other decriptive points, such as the exact syntax. It is why for instance i won't detail all of the flags used for the described commands. View this manual as a simplifier, more beginner friendly version of standard documentation you may usually find.
> [!NOTE]
> Still, if you wish for a more extensive coverage of the talked about themes, nothing is better than the standard UNIX user manual, to access , simply type **`man`** *`cmd`* where *cmd* is the command of which you want to learn the function, syntax, and much more (Works as well with standard C library functions).

### Caption and format
To avoid confusion when explaining any aspect, i made all my explanations respect a few formatting conventions.

- Listed elements like this sentence are the main points of information.
  
- Whenever a command's or a keyword's syntax is talked about, it adhers to it's own format:
**`keyword`** *`arguments/targets`* , the main, often eponymous (giving it's name to the whole command) element of syntax will be in **bold**, while any placeholder name will be in *italics* to signify it depends on user input, is an argument, or is dependant on the main keyword in any way.

- Footnoted elements generally won't be explained any more than they have been in said notes. View them as an invitation to do your own research.[^1]

[^1]: this note won't go into much detail, it's just here to give you a lead (; .
