# Shell Documentation
## Description
The following project is a personnal documentation for Shell programming. It is meant to be both as descriptive and as simple as possible to help in remembering the various elements touched on in this short simplified manual.

## Guidelines
As i mentionned, it is meant to be thorough, but it prioritizes intelligibility. Therefor, some aspects may be given less attention in favor of other decriptive points, such as the exact syntax. It is why i won't detail all of the flags, as you can easily look up a manual page for detailed information of each command (**`man`** *`command_name`*). I will however feature the most commonly used flags.
